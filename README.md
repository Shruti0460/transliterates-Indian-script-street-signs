# Bharat Script Transliterator – Street Sign Reader

### 📱 Read any Indian signboard in your language — instantly and offline.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Bharat Script Transliterator** is an Android application that helps travelers, migrants, and language learners read **Indian street signs, public boards, and direction markers** written in unfamiliar scripts.

Instead of translating the meaning, it **preserves pronunciation** — showing how a word is *read* in your preferred script.
For example, a Tamil street name can be transliterated into Devanagari or Gurmukhi, allowing users to **sound it out naturally**.

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement

India’s 22+ official scripts make navigation across states challenging.
Travelers and migrants often find it difficult to read local signboards written in unfamiliar scripts.
Existing apps focus on **translation**, not **transliteration**, making them ineffective for proper nouns like *place names*.

**Our goal:** Bridge this linguistic gap through a real-time, offline transliteration tool for all Indian scripts.
